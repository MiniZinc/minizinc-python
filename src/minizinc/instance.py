        Find the solutions to the given MiniZinc instance using the given solver

        where the solver specified in the solver configuration can understand
        the problem and then the solver will be requested to find the
        appropriate solution(s) to the problem.

                solving the instance.
            nr_solutions (Optional[int]): The requested number of solution.
                (Only available on satisfaction problems and when the ``-n``
                flag is supported by the solver).

                can use. (Only available when the ``-p`` flag is supported by
                the solver).
            random_seed (Optional[int]): Set the random seed for solver. (Only
                available when the ``-r`` flag is supported by the solver).
            free_search (bool): Allow the solver to ignore the search definition
                within the instance. (Only available when the ``-f`` flag is
                supported by the solver).
            all_solutions (bool): Request to solver to find all solutions. (Only
                available on satisfaction problems and when the ``-a`` flag is
                supported by the solver)
            intermediate_solutions (bool): Request the solver to output any
                intermediate solutions that are found during the solving
                process. (Only available on optimisation problems and when the
                ``-a`` flag is supported by the solver)
            optimisation_level (Optional[int]): Set the MiniZinc compiler
                optimisation level.

                - 0: Disable optimisation
                - 1: Single pass optimisation (default)
                - 2: Flatten twice to improve flattening decisions

                - 4: Probe bounds of all variables at the root node
                - 5: Probe values of all variables at the root node
