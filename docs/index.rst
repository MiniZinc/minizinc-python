MiniZinc Python
===============

MiniZinc Python provides a native python interface for the MiniZinc toolchain.
The package can interface with MiniZinc using the command line interface, the
``minizinc`` executable. The main goal of this library is to allow users to
use all of MiniZinc's capabilities directly from Python. This allows you to
use MiniZinc in your application, but also enables you to use MiniZinc in new
ways! Using MiniZinc in a procedural language allows you to use incremental
solving techniques that can be used to implement different kinds of
meta-heuristics.

..  note::

    The development of MiniZinc Python is still in its early stages. Although
    the module is fully supported and the functionality is stabilising, we
    will not guarantee that changes made before version 1.0 are backwards
    compatible. Similarly, the functionality of this module is closely
    connected to the releases of the main MiniZinc bundle. An update to this
    module might require an update to your MiniZinc installation.

    Once the project reaches version 1.0, it will abide by `Semantic Versioning
    <https://semver.org>`_. All (breaking) changes are recorded in the
    :ref:`changelog <changelog>`.
